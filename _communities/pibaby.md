description: We wish to create a prototype neonatal simulation manikin based on commodity components, powered by a Raspberry Pi credit-card sized computer and controlled by open source software. The project aims to improve access to simulation training, resulting in an improvement in the quality of care provided for patients needing resuscitation. This will be achieved through reducing the cost of the equipment required and inspiring a community of enthusiasts to customise and improve on our original manikin. Hospital simulation suites, medical or nursing schools and community life support/ first aid programmes will be able to alter and refine the hardware and software to suit their own needs for training.
