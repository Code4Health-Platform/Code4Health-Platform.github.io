name: Isolation Prioritisation App 
description: A UCL project to help dentists remember emergency procedures by providing the information in a compact and reliable way. However, our solution is not limited to dentistry, if implemented, it can be widely distributed and enable people to be ready to provide others with first aid. We highly believe in the wide impact of our project, as quick response to emergency situation is key to save lives.
