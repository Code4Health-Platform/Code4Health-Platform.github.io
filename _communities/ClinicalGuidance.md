name: Clinical Guidance App 
description: The UCL student Team took on the challenge of creating a mobile application to provide medical prescription guidance for doctors and nurses. Guidance information may be provided through tables or through decision trees, it depends on the guideline itself. We are developing an Android application which displays this information in a clear format and aids people in the medical profession.
