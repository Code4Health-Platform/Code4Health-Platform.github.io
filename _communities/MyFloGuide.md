name: MyFlo Guide App 
description: The application comes as an addition to an already existing SMS service, Florence. Using the Ionic framework, we managed to build a cross-platform application containing medical information on 5 major topics - Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Hypertension, Cardiovascular Disease and Type 2 Diabetes, with text and multimedia support. We expect to build a user-friendly application that contains up-to-date information from the NHS website.
