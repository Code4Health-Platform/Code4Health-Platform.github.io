name: BEACON - Clinical Guidelines Applications
description: An in-house developed clinical guidelines app for Plymouth Foundation Trust. The solution consists of a hybrid mobile app (iOS and Android)and a web front-end for viewing, editing and administration. We use MS SQL for data persistence and C# .NET restful APIs for communication between the web and mobile apps. We believe our key differentiator compared to other solutions (such as the Nottingham University NUG Guidelines app) is that our articles are designed first and foremost for easy reading on mobile devices, compared with displaying PDFs.
