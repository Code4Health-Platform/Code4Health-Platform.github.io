description: Anaesthetics is one of the most data rich specialities but much of this is lost as for even digitally mature trusts it is all still mostly recorded on paper. The overriding objective of this project is to extend the work, initially started at an NHS Hack Day, on creating an open source digital anaesthetic chart. This will involve - User interface work to make something attractive and usable, as well as functional - Modelling of patient flow and clinician working to create a system ready for pilot - Integration with an anaesthetic monitor to prove utility - Creating open APIâ€™s to facilitate interoperability with existing clinical systems.  My hope is that this work lays the foundation an open source, platform agnostic, system that allows for better working in perioperative medicine and to enable the use of the data created in a patient journey.
