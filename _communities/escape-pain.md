name: ESCAPE Pain   
description: ESCAPE-pain is a rehabilitation programme for people with chronic joint pain, that integrates educational self-management and coping strategies with an exercise regimen individualised for each participant. It helps people understand their condition, teaches them simple things they can help themselves with, and takes them through a progressive exercise programme so they learn how to cope with pain better.  The team will be working with Code4Health to understand and map patient reported outcome measures to assist with analysis of treatments
