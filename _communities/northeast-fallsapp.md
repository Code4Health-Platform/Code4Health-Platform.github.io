name: North East Falls App
description: Pressures on the NHS combined with a growth in the aging population, technological solutions need to be found to help with self management. This project developed a user-friendly, cross-platform medical mobile application which provides intuitive information on falls as well as providing appropriate user-risk assessments to help strengthen patient-doctor liaison for NHS North Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group. This amenable app was developed using the Ionic framework for iOS and Android devices.
