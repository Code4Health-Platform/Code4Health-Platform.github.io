name: Dementia Care Planning App 
description: Care planning for Dementia patients is essential to ensure the needs of patients is met. With the reduction in carers, advanced planning is required as time is precious. Our solution, a UCL student project, is to provide a web tool to provide care information for patients, carers and doctors  - more specifically, personalising a plan according to one's needs whilst monitoring their progress and implementing action plans.
