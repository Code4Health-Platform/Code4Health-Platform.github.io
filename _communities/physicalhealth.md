name: Making Black box algorithms for purpose in the NHS
description: In conjunction with Dr J.S. Bamrah of Manchester Mental Health Trust, Code4Health are working to create a Physical Health Monitoring system aimed primarily at psychiatric patients. The goal of the system is to use digital technology to assist mental health patients in taking more responsibility for their own physical health by monitoring key health values such as blood pressure and other metrics and additionally sharing this data with the clinicians who are involved in the patients care. The system will comprise of - 1. the "patient app"; a smartphone application for patients which allows them to enter and monitor key health data 2. the "clinician portal"; an application that allows the clinician to enter and monitor key health data for the patients that they are assisting 3. the "OpenEHR middleware"; a thin server layer which will create an abstract interface for both front-end apps to talk to the OpenEHR back-end as well as dealing with additional app-specific data such as managing the database for push notifications 4. the "OpenEHR back-end"; an open standard server system that will manage all of the data in the system
