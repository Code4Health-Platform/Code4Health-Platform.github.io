name: InfoKid App 
description: Often parents forget their appointment or are not fully understanding what exactly happened to their child. This app provides information on kidney problems related to kids. It is an interactive platform as parents can register their child on it and get updates on the status quo of their child's condition. Features like arranging appointments, as well as their reminders, are also included in this app. Expected result is a working collaborative technology to bridge the gap between doctors and parents when it comes to a child's medical state.
