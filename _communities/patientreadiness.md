name: An automatic system for gathering and visualizing patient readiness to get well
description: A research and development project with UCL based upon the following - Clincians believe they know if a patient is going to get better when they meet them.  But is it possible to understand a populations readiness to get better before meeting them. People get better when they are ready to do so. Peoples readiness is dependent upon a number of factors not least their perspective towards their condition.   This can be automatically sensed when people write to their diagnosed condition as though it were a person.  The system will use NLP techniques to sense activation status via the dialogue written.  This approach will be built upon using the wellbeing / NLP projects that UCL student are working on the period to August 2018, and have clinical input from mental health, public health, and strategic arms length bodies in in England and Wales. Its purpose is to inform the value of delivering health care.  It will be deployed for UX testing in April 2019 under a https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0 license. It is required to automatically give a perspective on a potential the publics readiness to get well.
