name: Mypals
description: Mypals is a web-based platform to connect people with life-limiting illnesses to people who can support them to remain independent, enjoy life and stay connected. Mypals will, in the first instance, be a digital platform (a web-based application), allowing people willing to volunteer to establish a connection with people with life-limiting illnesses. At a design event in July 2017, patients developed the following value proposition - I will be able to understand my illness; access the help I want to live life to the full; gain acceptance of what has to be; maintain tenacity of spirit; live and laugh often and loudly, especially with friends. Volunteers developed their own value proposition - I will add value, help people and fulfil my potential. Mypals will be developed as a white label product, ustomisable to each geographic location in which it operates.
