name: Hand Hygiene App 
description: The data collection of the Handwashing and Bare Below Elbow (BBE) audits within the organisation are currently a paper based process. It tracks the number of hand washing opportunities taken and checks for BBE compliance, before calculating overall percentages of staff compliance across multiples wards and directorates. A significant drawback to this is that it is very a time consuming audit process. Our solution is an application that allows for capture of such audit information through the user's input of data, as well as displaying the compliance rate using charts, before finally exporting all the information to Excel format. Ultimately, our application aims to provide utmost convenience for the auditors to carry out the audit process accurately.
