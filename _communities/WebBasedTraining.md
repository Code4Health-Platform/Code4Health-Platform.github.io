name: Training Feeback App 
description: A UCL project which focuses on getting feedback from trainees in the the NHS. This involves sending trainees a weekly SMS message in order to get feedback regarding their training for the week. All the data received can be monitored and viewed through our web application. Hence, we are able to compare the scores of each hospital and send each hospital a weekly report of their performance compared to other hospital. The overall aim of this project is to see if hospitals that receive trainee feedback are likely to improve their training over time as opposed to hospitals that donâ€™t get feedback.
