description: Currently in many hospital settings, management of the aftercare of patients following Labour Epidural is paper-based and error-prone. The workflow, while functioning, has extensive scope for improvement and integration with existing electronic care records. Significantly, these existing EHRs do not currently have the inbuilt flexibility/capability to provide a suitable workflow for managing requesting, insertion, and aftercare of labour epidurals. Our project aims to create a proof of concept ‘nano’-EHR which covers this specific use case and delivers a workflow which is above all safe, reliable, and user friendly. An electronic system furthermore gives the opportunity for additional functionality such as avoiding dual entry of clinical information where it can be pulled from the existing EHR. Management functions such as audit of personal practice and unit-wide audit and reporting are also much easier with an electronic system.
