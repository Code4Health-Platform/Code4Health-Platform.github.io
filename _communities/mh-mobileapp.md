name: Mental Health Mobile App
description: Students over at UCL have developed a Mental Health Mobile application alongside Code4Health North East Community group. North Tyneside CCG identified that it was difficult for patients and carers to access mental health services and guidance in the area due to disparate information and number of MH providers. The app was designed to help users manage their own condition and offer advice and guidance to help elevate some of the sigma behind this condition.
