name: CAMHS - Self Harm Prevention Tool
description: Students at UCL have worked with the Royal Bolton Hospital to develop a prototype "Self Harm Prevention tool" to help the youth community affected by mental health and behaviour disorders within the CAMHS program. The solution is a cross-platform tablet app that acts as a companion tool for clinicians to use during sessions with patients to quickly provide useful contacts, open relevant websites from within the app and share notes taken during the session via email.
