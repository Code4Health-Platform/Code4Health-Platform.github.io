name: Demystifying the process of optimizing 111 / 999 using ML / AI
description: A UCL Code4Health project to explore the following - 30+ million 111/ 999 calls per annum are managed by call handling centres across Britain. It is possible to decrease the load on callers by using automatic call handing systems.  In this project speech to text (STT) technologies will create content from synthetic and actual 111 / 999 data. A system will be developed using previous UCL projects that will enable a clinician to understand what type of dialogue needs to be optimized.  The need, or not, of commercial solutions will become apparent. The system will enable a non clinical user to do preliminary NLP (using a script created on a previous UCL project).  The user will be able to log the intents that are relevant for use in commercial systems.  The user will be able to provide these a functional specification for telephony providers.
