name: Deep Learning Drug Treatments - 'deepDrug'
description: Computer science has begun to shape the future of medicine as more and more medical data is collected everyday and published in datasets for researchers and developers to use. In addition, personalized medicine has the ability to completely change the landscape of cancer drug treatment worldwide. Patients' genetics, medical history, and the development of their cancer can differ greatly, which calls for a need of more personal treatment. Personalized treatment is geared towards the patient themselves instead of receiving a more general treatment that is usually fairly ineffective. To make breakthroughs in personalized medicine, we look to deep learning. Deep learning has become a very effective method to speed up the drug discovery process and develop personalized treatments which saves time and money, but most importantly lives. By using databases like PubChem, Tox21, the European Nucleotide Archive, and more, deep neural networks can develop personalized drugs for cancer patients that target the cancer in the most effective ways. The community looks to bring together all different experts ranging from biochemists to computer scientists since the problem must be approached from different perspectives in order to make substantial progress. In the future, the community looks to build a software framework that will assist doctors by recommending different drug treatments that are the best for their patients.
