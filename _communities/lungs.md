description: Lung function testing is used by healthcare professionals to diagnose respiratory disease, and to monitor respiratory health. This project seeks to develop a digital tool for recording and communicating the results of function testing between patients and healthcare professionals. This will enable us to launch a pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a digital solution compared to existing paper based workflows and dated tools.
